This is me testing the SFML liabry in Cpp.
I have 3 cpp files:
- main.cpp
    - Basic sfml window with an image as a background.
- seedgen.cpp
    - Genrates random number of specified lengh with provided seed.
- sprite.cpp
    - basic movement system on a grid with each square that is stepped on being highlighted.
